some useful system info. Any info that you can get at with Lua can be displayed.

WARNING: The amdcpu.dll uses WinRing0.dll for low level access to the cpu. This low level 
        access may make your system to crash please. It hasnt here and I have used the 
        lib for 2 years. I dont think this will happen to you if try this software.

        If the above makes you nervous,
            1) BACKUP your system drive before trying 
            2) remove the amdcpu.dll and WinRing files and fix the systeminfo.lua
